I would like to create a very professional looking website which is an English Premier League predictions competition.

Tech Stack

React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + React Hook Form + TanStack Query for the front end
The UI needs to work in Mobile too
C# API for the backend 
Postgres for the DB  
Render to host the api 
Vercel to host the web page


The competition has the following rules:

There are 38 gameweeks in a season
Each gameweek of fixtures a player must select an English Premier League team they think will win.
If the side they select wins they get 3 points
If the side they select draws they get 1 point
If the side they select loses they get 0 points
We also calculate the goal difference of their picks, so if their pick wins 3-1, they would have 3 goals for and 1 goal against for a goal difference of 2. 
The goal difference is used to separate teams that have the same number of points.
Once you select a team once you can no longer select them again.
At the 21 gameweek when you have selected each team once, the teams are refreshed and you can pick them all again but only once for the final 18 gameweeks of the season.
The player with the most points at the end of 38 weeks will win the competition.
Once the first game of a gameweek starts you can no longer make a pick that week
If you have forgotten to make a pick, you get the team available to you that is in the lowest position in the real English Premier League table


In order to allow this we need to create the following controls / components 

A login page 
A create user page
User should have first name, last name, email addresses, phone number (optional), photo (optional)
An admin page
Allow to deactivate users
Mark users as paid

A dashboard screen for a logged in user containing the following controls

Summary Component 
Shows the current gameweek
When the deadline is for the current gameweek
Your total points
Your rank among other players
A summary of your picks which is a one row grid, with the following columns
- P : The number of picks you’ve made that have results
- W: The number of winning picks you’ve made
- D: The number of drawing picks you’ve made

This component should be a grid with three columns
Gameweek

Pts  
The grid should have 38 rows for each Gameweek
The pick field should be populated with the side you have selected for that gameweek 
If you haven’t selected a side for that Gameweek it should show ‘No Pick Yet’
Gameweeks in the future you should be able to select a pick from a drop down of sides that you haven’t yet selected
In the first half of the season gameweek 1 - 20.  Picks in the 2nd half of the season should be locked

Fixtures Component 
This should contain the fixtures for each gameweek
Grouped by gameweek
For each gameweek it should show the team in Red if you’ve already selected them in a past gameweek
It should show the team in Green if you’ve selected them in that gameweek
It should show the team in Grey if you’ve selected them in a future gameweek

A League Component

This should rank all players in the game in a grid
Highlighted the currently logged in player 
Have the following columns
